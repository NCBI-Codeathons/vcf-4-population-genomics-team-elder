## Project Goals
     Determine the minor allele frequency of variants from VCF files. Characterize dominant variants of divergent lineages.
## Approach
      Import VCF files in AWS. Establish QC metrics. Use BASH to query files. Compare minor allele variants to divergent lineages. Use machine learning algorithms to predict emerging divergent variants.
## Results

## Future Work
