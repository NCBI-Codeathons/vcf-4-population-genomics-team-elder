## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to compare SARS-CoV-2 Intra-host allele frequencies within a large dataset to analyze the minor allele frequencies not identified in the consensus fasta file. The VCF files will be plotted along the SARS-CoV-2 genome and variant time periods will be identified. Previously identified mutations from long-term SARS-CoV-2 infections, Paxlovid resistance mutations, and other Variant of Concern (VOC) mutations will be used as a guideline to identify mutation trends. This will give an underlying understanding of mutations developing during and before a major SARS-CoV-2 lineage takes over (i.e.. BA.5, XBB.1.5). Mutation patterns identified may enable machine learning to be applied to identify future VOCs.
